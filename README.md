You access the color palette container by hovering over the icon of the pallete. Once you select a color you can color each pixel individually by clicking on it, or hold the mouse down and color as many pixels at a time as you want! The only limits to what you paint are your imagination! Maybe you like lobsters as much as I do and you want to paint something like this:
